//! Recursive-descent RST parser with docutils-0.22.4 fidelity (M2 wave 1:
//! block grammar only — the inline parser arrives in wave 2).
//!
//! Fidelity contract: output `pformat()` is byte-identical to
//! `docutils.parsers.rst.Parser` parse-layer output for the construct set in
//! `tests/fixtures/doctree_differential.json`. Transforms (doctitle
//! promotion, target propagation, transition hoisting, message filtering)
//! are explicitly NOT applied here; they arrive as separate components in
//! later waves. Behavior sources: the committed differential fixture and the
//! probe notes in docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-07-m2-wave1-probes.md.
